# cutex-compiler

#FIRST OF ALL:
Cutex compiler is just a study project which combines my effort of learning how to use git and how to make compilers. The language i'm making compiler of is totally self made and all the language grammar is produced as a part of experimentation. So kindly be gentle if things seem totally unnecessay and cause you drain bamage and you go completely dbsura.

<b>WARNING:</b>  
Code is highly uncommented  

  All Commits are welcome.
  
  
  Compile using the src/compile.bat file
